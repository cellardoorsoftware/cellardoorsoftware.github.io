### An Idea is Born

My son, Alex, had been asking me for a skateboard for months. We told him that if he saved half the cost of a skateboard, we'd pitch in the other half. Needless to say, I'm writing this with a foot that's broken in 3 places from skateboard.

But somewhere in between, a bond with my son was formed, a passion was reignited, and an app idea became reality.

I'm still working hard nights and weekends to get the beta ready, but here a screenshot of the app in development. 

Say hello to sesh!!

sesh is my new app that I'm working on to record and track my trick and trick attempts.

Instead of just making an app for recording myself failing at skateboarding for those sweet social media likes, I decided this would be a good opportunity for me to [learn](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/) [some](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) [new](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) [things](https://fastlane.tools), as well as apply what I think are a set of best practices for building a best in class application -- my best attempts at a [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) architecture without coloring too much outside the lines*. I'll also touch on DevOps-ey things like making your app build super easy to script. Or maybe at some point, swap out `xcodebuild` for something like say `bazel`

For an undetermined number of posts following this one, I plan on wasting electricity putting my experiences, opinions, and insights while building this idea. Some topics include:

- Xcode?! WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S A LOGICAL PLACE FOR THAT FILE!!?
- Commenting out code: a deep dive into SwiftUI debugging
- CloudKit: This is too easy, whats the.. oh, there it is.
- Cross platform code: choosing between going to bed now, or staying up until four until you did the thing you should have done from the beginning.

I hope you'll join me.
